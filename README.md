### About
This is a Unity project file for a virtual light art installation. It cannots assets and scripts that connects to the DMXForArtists library github.com/jaysonh/DMXForArtists and enables one to control a virtual light installation in Unity with the same code that sends DMX signals to an FTDI USB DMX device.

This project was used for the 2022 CAA:PlayShop Data to Light workshops.
